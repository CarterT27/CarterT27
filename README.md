    <h2>🧠 Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Carter Tran — currently studying Data Science and Math-Econ at UC San Diego 🐢.<br>
        I spend my time bouncing between studying cafes, coding late-night projects, and training ML models for competitions and research.<br>
        When I'm not wrangling data, you'll probably find me looking for new restaurants, driving around Southern California, or playing the LinkedIn puzzles 🧩.
